## :book: How it works

* Scan the networks.
* Use WEB Interface *
* Launch a FakeAP instance to imitate the original access point
* Spawns a MDK3 process, which deauthenticates all users connected to the target network, so they can be lured to connect to the FakeAP and enter the Password.
* A fake DNS server is launched in order to capture all DNS requests and redirect them to the host running the script


##  :heavy_exclamation_mark: Requirements
